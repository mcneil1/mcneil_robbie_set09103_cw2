Advanced web technology

For this coursework I developed a flask web app that resembled a social media website. The site allowed users to create an account and log-in to the web app,
where they could make posts and view other users profiles. This required using databases to store user info as well as encryption techniques to keep user info safe.

Overall grade for this work was 70%
